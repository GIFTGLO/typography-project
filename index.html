        <p class="text1">You may love your cat, but you may not be fully aware of just how cool your she — and her overall species — really is.
        For example, did you know that cats have an extra organ that allows them to taste scents? Or that they developed meowing
        as a way to communicate exclusively with humans?
        </p>
       <p class="text2">Clearly, there’s more to your little feline friend than meets the eye. So, to help you fully appreciate how awesome cats
        are, we asked cat care professionals on Care.com — namely, cat sitters, boarders, and groomers — to share their favorite
        fun facts about these mystical creatures. We then pulled together a list of the 101 most amusing cat facts that you can
        share with your friends and family.
